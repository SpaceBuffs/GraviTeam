*GraviTeam*
A major difficulty among international scientists is finding a collaborative, social interface where scientists from all over the world can share ideas and design space mission experiments. Our solution is a web based application that uses technology and social media to allow for cross-world communication, design, and experimentation.

*SpaceBuffs*
SpaceBuffs is made of 6 senior students studying Computer Science Engineering at CU Boulder. Hope Sanford, Sierra Flynn, Heather Dykstra, Josh Weaver, Semere Ghebrechristos, and Chris Acuna.

 
*Overview*
GraviTeam is a web-based Dashboard that allows you to have multiple mini-applications running at the same time. This provides a seamless atmosphere for scientific interaction and collaboration; allowing experiments to be designed, implemented and discussed. The tool has 5 major features including a user log in, white board, 3D model, timeline, and instant messaging.
